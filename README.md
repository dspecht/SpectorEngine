# SpectorEngine

This engine is a project to try and refine aspects of engine crafting.
Currently this is a solo project

To build: Modify the build.bat file with the path to the directory you installed to as it is not a reletive path.

To Test: As of this edit there is no tests.

To Contribute: Please talk to me through messages or email at drive137 @ gmail . com   ( this not made as a URL to avoid scanners)

Issue creation is not defined well as of this edit since the project is currently solo so there is not much need for issue creation.

The Current focus is on graphics and the Initalization of graphics api's
  Vulkan is the focus as of this edit, with opengl being put on the back burner until that is working.
